A comprehensive R-based pipeline for bulk RNA-seq quality control, differential expression analysis, and enrichment analysis.
                                                                        📋 Overview
This repository contains R scripts for end-to-end RNA-seq analysis, from raw count matrices and metadata file. The pipeline uses DESeq2 null model for quality control followed by Principal component analysis for visualizing the sample distribution.
✨ Key Features
🔍 Quality Control & Preprocessing

Multi-level QC: Expression density plots, library size distributions, batch effect visualization
Outlier detection: Identification of outlier samples (using ±2 SD threshold) with visualization
Batch assessment: RNA.Batch and Library.Batch tracking with color-coded visualizations

                                📊 Dimensionality Reduction

PCA analysis: Variance stabilizing transformation (VST) with top variable genes
Multi-variable encoding: Integrated visualization of batch (color), treatment (shape), sex (shape), and strain (ellipses)
PC association testing: ANOVA-based testing for metadata-PC relationships
Correlation analysis: Spearman (categorical) and Pearson (continuous) correlations with PC2

🧪 Differential Expression

DESeq2 framework: Standard Wald test with multiple model designs
Model-based contrasts: Support for treatment, sex, strain, and interaction effects
Batch correction: Employing DESeq2 batch correction covariate approach in its robust negative binomial generalized linear model
Deterministic tie-breaking: Wald statistic ranking for gene set enrichment analysis

🔬 Enrichment Analysis

fGSEA pipeline: Fast gene set enrichment analysis with 10,000 permutations
Multiple databases: MSigDB Hallmark, GO-BP, KEGG, Reactome support, etc.
Cross-model comparison: Heatmap visualization of pathway enrichment across models based on leading edge genes
Top pathway selection: Mean absolute normalized enrichment score (NES) ranking
